### Hi there 👋 I am Daniel Cunningham
I am a software developer currently working on finishing my schooling at Boise Codeworks.
Proficient in HTML, CSS, Java, Bootstrap, Vue, Node.Js, C#, MYSQL, AGILE/Scrum methods.
Ask me about some of the projects I have in the works. I love doing collaborative projects and doing fullstack development because I get to create and see how
everything comes together to make a website. Ask me about some funfacts about myself. (You wont be disappointed)
